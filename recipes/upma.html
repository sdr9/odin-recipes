    <h1>Upma</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Upma is a flavorful South Indian breakfast dish made from rava or cream of wheat. 
        This traditional dish involves cooking roasted rava in water that has been flavored 
        by ghee (or oil), cashews, urad dal (lentils), chana dal (husked chickpeas), onion, 
        ginger and additional herbs and spices. Sugar can be added for a mildly sweet and 
        savory dish.</p>
    <p>This steaming hot breakfast dish can be made vegan by using oil instead of ghee. The 
        main ingredient in any upma recipe is rava. Also called suji or sooji in Hindi 
        and cream of wheat or semolina in English, it is simply granulated wheat. Thus 
        this breakfast food is known as Suji ka Upma in North India.</p>
    <p>What really makes an upma recipe special are all the fried ingredients that are used 
        for tempering. These ingredients can vary depending on the recipe, but usually include 
        some sweet, savory and nutty flavors. Upma is a traditional breakfast served in restaurants 
        throughout South India, including Maharashtra. It is also a common breakfast prepared in 
        South Indian homes. In fact, upma was a regular breakfast or evening snack in my house 
        while growing up.</p>
