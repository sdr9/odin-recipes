    <h1>Chapati</h1>
    <img src="images/chapati.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chapatis are made using a soft dough comprising wheat flour, salt and water. 
        It is more finely ground than most western-style whole wheat flours.</p>
    <p>Chapati dough is typically prepared with flour, salt and water, kneaded with 
        the knuckles of the hand made into a fist and left to proof for at least 
        10 or 15 minutes to an hour for the gluten in the dough to develop. After 
        proofing, the dough becomes softer and more pliable. Small portions of the 
        dough are pinched off and formed into round balls that are pressed between 
        the two palms to form discs which are then dipped into flour and rolled out 
        on a circular rolling board (a chakla), using a rolling pin known as a velan 
        or belan, into a flat disc. There are also automatic roti makers which automate 
        the whole process.</p>
    <p>The rolled-out dough is then thrown on the preheated dry tava and cooked on both sides. 
        In some regions of the Indian subcontinent chapatis are only partially cooked on the 
        skillet, and then cooked directly over a flame, which makes them puff up. The hot steam 
        cooks the chapati rapidly from the inside. In some parts of northern India and eastern 
        Pakistan, this is called a phulka. In southern parts of India, it is called a pulka. 
        It is also possible to puff up the roti directly on the tava. Once cooked, chapatis are 
        often topped with butter or ghee. In western regions of Maharashtra, some oil is added 
        inside rolled out dough and then put on tava, this is distinct from paratha.</p>
